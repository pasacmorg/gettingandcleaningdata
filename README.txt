This project uses an R script called run_analysis.R that performs following steps
on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

See the code book 'code_book.md' for full processing details and variable descriptions
